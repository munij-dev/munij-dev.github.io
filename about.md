Hi! I'm Juan Muniain, a software engineer and independent game developer from Mexico. My goal is to turn awesome game ideas into reality, and deliver amazing experiences.
<br/>
<br/>
This site is a portfolio of the works Iâ€™ve contributed to and developed on my own, which includes personal projects, games and jam submissions. You can check out my github page where I host most of the works found here.
<br/>
<br/>
With a background in Computer Science, Video Games and 3D Animation, my primary skills are in gameplay and shader programming with Unity (C#), as well as hard surface modeling, rigging, texturing and animation with Blender, Maya and 3ds Max. I also use Adobe programs primarily for texturing and UI design. 
<br/>
<br/>
Although game development is my strong suit, I'm also skilled in front-end programming with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Ruby, Jekyll, and a bit of MySQL for back-end related things.
<br/>
<br/>
I also co-founded my university's Game Development [club](https://www.instagram.com/gamedevs.csf/), which usually hosts game jams, seminars and other industry events.
<br/>
<br/>
"munij" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my projects under, usually accompanied by the picture in the bottom left.
