Hi! I'm Juan Muniain, a Software Engineer, Game Developer and 3D Animator from Mexico City. I'm currently working as Strategic and Creative Director at Burning Boats Studios, a small indie development company I co-founded with a group of highly skilled developers from my home country.
<br/>
<br/>
This site is a portfolio which includes the works Iâ€™ve contributed to or developed on my own, such as animation and modeling reels, games and jam submissions. "munij" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my projects under, usually accompanied by the picture in the bottom left.
<br/>
<br/>
My primary skills are in 3D animation, rigging and modeling with Maya and 3ds Max, as well as animation and gameplay programming in Unity and Unreal Engine (C#, C++). Although animation and game development are my strong suit, I'm also knowledgeable in front-end development using JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, and Ruby (Jekyll).
<br/>
<br/>
I also co-founded my university's Game Development [club](https://www.instagram.com/gamedevs.csf/) with the goal of creating a network of students from multiple faculties, and aiding newcomers. The club usually hosts game jams and seminars on various topics.
