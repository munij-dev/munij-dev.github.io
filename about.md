Hi! I'm Juan Muniain, a Software Engineer and Game Developer from Mexico City. My goal is to turn awesome game ideas into reality, and deliver amazing experiences.
<br/>
<br/>
This site is a portfolio of the works Iâ€™ve contributed to and developed on my own, which includes personal projects, games and jam submissions. You can check out my github page where I host most of the works found here. "munij" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my projects under, usually accompanied by the picture in the bottom left.
<br/>
<br/>
My primary skills are in gameplay and shader programming with Unity (C#), as well as hard surface modeling, rigging, texturing and animation with Blender, Maya and 3ds Max. I also use Photoshop for textures and UI design and aseprite for quick pixel art.
<br/>
<br/>
Although game development is my strong suit, I'm also skilled in front-end programming with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Ruby (Jekyll), and a bit of MySQL for back-end related things.
<br/>
<br/>
I also co-founded my university's Game Development [club](https://www.instagram.com/gamedevs.csf/) with the goal of creating a network of students from multiple faculties, and aiding newcomers. The club usually hosts game jams and seminars of various topics.
