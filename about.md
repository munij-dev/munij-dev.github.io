Hi! I'm Juan Muniain, a Software Engineer and Game Developer from Mexico City. My goal is to turn awesome game ideas into reality, and deliver unique experiences.
<br/>
<br/>
This site is a portfolio which includes the works Iâ€™ve contributed to or developed on my own, such as animation and modeling reels, games and jam submissions. You can check out my github page where I host some of the works found here. "munij" is the pseudonym I go by and what I publish my projects under, usually accompanied by the picture in the bottom left.
<br/>
<br/>
My primary skills are in 3D animation and modeling with Maya and 3ds Max, as well as gameplay programming in Unity and Unreal Ungine (C#, C++). I also know about rigging, texturing and shading workflows with these tools.
<br/>
<br/>
Although animation and game development are my strong suit, I'm also knowledgeable in front-end development using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Ruby (Jekyll), and a bit of MySQL for back-end related things.
<br/>
<br/>
I also co-founded my university's Game Development [club](https://www.instagram.com/gamedevs.csf/) with the goal of creating a network of students from multiple faculties, and aiding newcomers. The club usually hosts game jams and seminars of various topics.
